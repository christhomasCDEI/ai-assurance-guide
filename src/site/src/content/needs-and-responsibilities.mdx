A range of actors including regulators, developers, executives, and frontline users, need to check that AI systems are trustworthy and compliant with regulation, and to demonstrate this to others. However, these actors often have limited information, or lack the appropriate specialist knowledge to check and verify others’ claims about this.

In the diagram below we have categorised three important groups of actors who will benefit from the development of an AI assurance ecosystem: The AI supply chain, AI assurance service providers and, supporting structures for AI assurance.

The efforts of different actors in this space are both interdependent and complimentary. Building a mature assurance ecosystem will therefore require active and coordinated effort. The actors specified in the are not meant to be exhaustive, but represent the key roles in the emerging AI assurance ecosystem.

This simplified diagram highlights the main roles of these four important groups of actors in the AI assurance ecosystem. However it is important to note that while the primary goal of the ‘supporting structures’ is to set out criteria for trustworthy AI through regulation, technical standards or guidance, these actors can also provide assurance services via advisory, audit and certification functions e.g. the <OutboundLink href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/jobs/departments/good-practice-audit/">ICO’s Assurance function</OutboundLink>. Government and other public sector organisations also play the ‘executive’ role when procuring and deploying AI systems.

These actors can each play a number of interdependent roles within an assurance ecosystem. The table below illustrates each actor’s role in demonstrating the trustworthiness of AI systems and their own requirements for building trust in AI systems.

## AI supply chain

| Assurance user      | Role in demonstrating trustworthiness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Requirements for building trust                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Developer**           | need (1) to ensure their development is both compliant with applicable regulations and guidelines and (2) to communicate their AI system’s compliance and hence trustworthiness to regulators, executives, frontline users and affected individuals. This will require agreed rules for the levels of transparency and information sharing required to demonstrate compliance.                                                                                                                                     | Need clear standards, regulations and practice guidelines in place so that they can have trust that the technologies they develop will be compliant and they will not be liable.                                      |

| **Governments**      | that want to encourage responsible adoption of AI systems need to help shape an ecosystem of assurance services tools to have confidence that AI will be deployed responsibly, in compliance with laws and regulations, and in a way that does not unduly hinder economic growth.                                                                                                    | Require confidence that AI systems being developed and deployed in their jurisdiction will be compliant with applicable laws and regulation and will respect citizens rights and freedoms, to trust that AI systems will not cause harm and will not damage the government’s reputation.                 |
| **Regulators**       | who see increasing use of AI systems in their scope need to encourage, test and confirm that AI systems are compliant with their regulations, incentivise best practice and create the conditions for the trustworthy development and use of AI.                                                                                                                                     | Require confidence that the use of AI systems that fall within their regulatory scope are trustworthy, compliant with regulation and guidelines of best practice. To enable this, regulators need confidence that they have the appropriate regulatory mandate and the appropriate skills and resources. |
| **Standards bodies** | Need to convene actors including industry and academia to develop commonly accepted standards that can be evaluated or tested against and encourage adoption of existing standards, to demonstrate (1) compliance with laws, regulations (2) other norms or principles, and to set best practices for addressing risks and establishing common language to improve safety and trust. | Require confidence that standards accepted by AI developers, users and affected parties and that they are appropriate to ensure trustworthy AI where they are being used.                                                                                                                                |

| **Professional body**              | Need to set and enforce professional standards of good practice and ethics, which can be important both for developers and assurance service providers.                                                                                            | Need to maintain oversight of the knowledge, skills, conduct and practice for AI assurance
