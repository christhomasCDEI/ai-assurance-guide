For AI, a number of different aspects of an AI system and the broader context in which it is deployed need to be assured. While there are many lists of objectives and risks for AI, there is an emerging <OutboundLink href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3518482">consensus</OutboundLink> about the types of risk and harm, and aspects of performance that need to be understood.

Potential subject matter for assuring AI systems:

- Intended use - is the intended use of the system beneficial and appropriate for the type of system?
- Accuracy - Is the system accurate and effective in achieving its intended goals?
- Robustness - Is the system’s performance consistent across a variety of inputs or in different conditions?
- Unfair bias - Does the system perpetuate unfair bias?
- Explainability / interpretability - can the reasons behind a system’s decisions or predictions be explained to those affected?
- Security - Is the system vulnerable to cyber attack or malicious use?
- Societal impact - Could the operation of the system result in negative consequences for people and society?
- Privacy - Does the system ensure individuals privacy rights are respected and protected?
- Human rights - Does the system pose a risk to individuals’ human rights?
- Management processes and controls - Are the appropriate processes and controls in place to manage risks in the development or deployment of the system?

The levels at which these subject matter could be assessed:

- Input data
- Test performance
- Real world outcomes
- Process
- Organisations
- Developers

Considering the wide range of potential subject matter for AI Assurance, there is an important challenge to ensure that suitable assurance techniques are adopted, reflecting the characteristics of each subject matter. Deciding on this will involve active participation from across the ecosystem. Government, regulators and standards bodies will need to work closely with industry, academia and civil society to set suitable assurable requirements for AI systems.

For example, the potential societal impacts of an AI system before deployment need to be measured differently to how we would measure the accuracy of an AI system in performing a specific task. In the latter case the accuracy of an AI system can be established with a relatively high level of certainty using a quantitative metric. This is notwithstanding the potential for <OutboundLink href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/cloud/watson-studio/drift">model drift</OutboundLink>, which will require ongoing, live testing to ensure the system remains accurate across its lifecycle. In contrast, when thinking about potential societal impacts of an AI system, assessors need to establish potential impacts resulting from a system which would not occur in a counterfactual world in which the technology was not being developed.

This process involves qualitative analysis such as public engagement, futures thinking and consideration of public values. Impact assessments provide assurance to the extent that proper procedures have been followed to identify, mitigate and assign responsibility for impacts - not that all possible impacts have in fact been mitigated (this is an unachievable level of certainty). In contrast, the accuracy of a model against a predetermined standard can be assured to a far greater degree of certainty. While the potential for model drift might decrease this certainty when the system is deployed and used, this can be mitigated via ongoing accuracy testing.

We think that because of these strengths and weaknesses, the assurance techniques listed in section 2.1 provide a useful toolbox of complementary techniques that should be considered when trying to establish trust in AI. However it is important that assurance techniques are coherently and deliberately chosen to suit the nature of the subject matter.

Choosing an appropriate metric is, in the first place, subjective. A bias audit can then be carried out by an internal or external team to determine the performance of the algorithm in relation to the chosen metric. This test alone cannot determine whether or not the algorithm is unfairly biased - this requires considering and setting a subjective benchmark for the level of demographic parity that is acceptable.

For example, a computer vision system for an autonomous vehicle will require a high level of robustness due to the serious potential harms of malfunction. Robustness properties for a computer vision system in an autonomous vehicle include: Image noise, deviations from optimal image conditions e.g. a branch partially covering a sign; geometric transformations e.g. road signs shifted at different angles; colour transformations e.g. differences in performance in daylight and nighttime.</p><p>Performance testing metrics and formal verification can be used to test and quantify a system’s robustness properties. However, judgement is required to decide on the relevant robustness properties and what robustness scores are acceptable. </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Interpretability refers to how easily cause and effect can be determined for the outputs of a system. </p><p>Acceptable levels of explainability and interpretability vary depending on whether the use case is high or low risk. In high risk cases, drawing unjustified conclusions from data could cause serious harm.Explainability can be either an inherent characteristic of an AI system or it can be approximated by other methods. This latter type of explainability can be important for so-called ‘black box’ models like artificial neural networks. </p><p>Explainability and interpretability are not always ends in themselves for assurance but enable systems to be audited and understood to come to conclusions about their trustworthiness. However, explainability and interpretability of a model are important in their own right for developers to check their models <OutboundLink href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01332-6">beyond just their performance</OutboundLink>, to rule out that a system is making predictions based upon meta-data rather than the specified input data.

For a traditional credit score, they will need to process data relating to the customer’s credit history, such as payment history, length of credit history, number of credit accounts. An alternative credit scoring agency may additionally use personality data or social media data.</p><p>The credit scoring agency will need to explain what type of data is collected to build the credit profile, why this data is relevant to prediction the customers credit score, and the likely impact that such a score will have on the customer I.e. being approved for or denied credit.</p> |
| Intended use / benefit                     | The scope and acceptable use cases for an AI system need to be qualitatively assessed based on the function of the AI system and the goals for using it.
